            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Online dating has become widely popular in recent years due to platforms like Tinder, Hinge, and
                Match.com, which make it easy to connect with potential partners. However, there are segment of users
                who may find it difficult to approach potential dates directly.
                Additionally, data shows that more than half of young people in America do not have romantic partners,
                highlighting a need for support in the dating world.

                Basis the above premises, we aim to develop a dating app that allows users to assign friends who can
                help and encourage in finding in their dating choices. </p>

        <p> Single young adults who are looking for a date, they need support, encouragement and approval from their
            friends or family.</p>
        <h3 class="heading">Solution</h3>
        <p> Wingmate app empowers users to take the lead in their dating journey by creating their own profiles, setting
            preferences, and enlisting friends as "Wingmates" to validate their choices.</p>

                <h4> Understanding the maket</h4>
            </div>

            <p> In 2016, when there were 240.9 million dating app users worldwide but in 2021, that number jumped up to
                323.9 million users. Tinder is the Market leader. With Bumble, women can take the initiative when it
                comes to talking to men, while Tinder makes making matches fun, whether it's for romantic dates or
                friendships.
                The Hinge app lets users connect via prompts, while Happn is a location-based app. Wingman is for those
                looking to help their single friend or family member find a date. Coffee Meets Bagel is for a serious
                relationship and meaningful connections. It is the closest competitor to our app Wingmate.
                However, the user is the hero, he or she needs to create his or her own profile, preferences, and then
                assign friends(Wingmate) to validate their choices. </p>

        <p>
            Conducted User Research to map out: <br>
            The role of friends/close ones in the dating lives of users
            and how users interact and behave towards the existing dating apps.
        </p>
        <h4> Understanding the maket</h4>
        <ul> Findings
            <li> Among our respondents, 50% are in a relationship, and the rest are single. </li>
            <li> The respondents are really close to their families and friends, so their opinions are also important.
            </li>
            <li> Several of our respondents send screenshots of their romantic interest profiles and messages to their
                friends as a way of checking their friends' opinions. </li>
            <li> There is always a concern for the safety of the woman while on a dating app.</li>
            <li> Catfishing is also a concern for them. </li>

                    <p> Young adults who are looking for romantic partners, need their friends' support and

                    <p> We have observed that many young adults looking for a date share screenshots of their potential
                        dates' profiles to their close friends so they can get their opinion and validation.

                        How might we help young single adults who need validation on their dates gain more confidence
                        and have more exciting and safe dating experience? </p>

                                        <p> With a revenue projection of US$1.29bn in 2022 and estimation of 64.5m users
                                            by 2027, the online dating space is definitely a fertile ground to be in.

                                            So, along with the current features shown in the prototype, we plan to work
                                            out more features including the user journey from Wingmate’s perspective.

                                            Some of the challenges we faced during the project is figuring out the key
                                            features that would stand out from the rest of the existing apps in the
                                            market.

                                            We would be working on the imagery of the app that would address to all
                                            genders. Currently, it is perceived to be leaning towards to female only.
